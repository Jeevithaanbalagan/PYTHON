ğŸ”¹ Question:
   Write a Python function called filter_even_numbers that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with only the even numbers.
 ğŸ”¹ Bonus Twist (optional):
 If the list is empty or contains no even numbers, return "No even numbers found" instead.


def eve(numbers):
    evenlst=[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    if not evenlst:
        return "No even numbers"
    return evenlst



var=[1,2,3,4]
sam=eve(var)
print(sam)
